## 🐍 Classic Snake Game

### Description:
This project is a modern recreation of the classic Snake game using Python’s Turtle graphics module. The player controls the snake to collect food, growing in length with each bite while avoiding collisions with its own tail or the screen boundaries.

### 🔍 Features & Learning Outcomes 
- Applied Object-Oriented Programming (**OOP**) and **Inheritance** for game structure
- Implemented Turtle's **event listener** system
- Practiced GUI programming with Python's built-in **turtle** module
- Used **list and tuple slicing** to manage snake movement and growth logic

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
3. Run the game from the terminal: **python3 main.py**
