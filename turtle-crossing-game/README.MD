### 🔍Features & Learning Outcomes
- Implemented Object-Oriented Programming (**OOP**) and **Inheritance**
- Utilized **Python’s Turtle Graphics** for UI and event handling
- Applied **event listeners** and GUI functions for interactive gameplay
- Used the **random** module for car placement and behavior
- Organized code with **constants** for better maintainability
