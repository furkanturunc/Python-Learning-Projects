## ⏰ Pomodoro Timer

### Description:
The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method to increase productivity. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
In this app, when the user press the **Start button**, timer runs as to the following plan:
- Work for 25 min
- Break for 5 min 
- Work for 25 min
- Break for 5 min 
- Work for 25 min
- Break for 5 min 
- Work for 25 min
- Break for 20 min (Long Break)

After each work session, a **check-mark** is put on window to show the progress. When the user press the **Reset button**, timer is reset

*Note:* Pomodoro means tomato in Italian, that's why the logo of the timer is chosen as tomato

### 🔍Features & Learning Outcomes
- Utilized **Python’s tkinter module** for GUI
- Applied **event-driven programming** and GUI components
- Organized code with **constants** for better maintainability

### 🚀 How to Run
